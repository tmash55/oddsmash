// Test file to validate optimized LLM prompt
const optimizedPrompt = `Parse this sports betting slip into JSON. Extract ALL selections (player props AND game bets).

CRITICAL RULES:
â€¢ Parlay odds (like +3200) = IGNORE for individual selections
â€¢ Individual odds near each player = USE those
â€¢ No individual odds shown = use "N/A"

MARKET MAPPING:
"HOME RUN"|"HR" â†’ "Home_Runs"
"HITS"|"1+ HITS" â†’ "Hits" 
"DOUBLE"|"2B" â†’ "Doubles"
"TRIPLE"|"3B" â†’ "Triples"
"STOLEN BASE"|"SB" â†’ "Stolen_Bases"
"STRIKEOUTS"|"K's"|"SO" â†’ "Strikeouts"
"TOTAL BASES"|"TB" â†’ "Total_Bases"
"RBI"|"RUNS BATTED IN" â†’ "RBIs"
"H+R+RBI"|"HITS + RUNS + RBIS" â†’ "Hits_Runs_RBIs"
"RUNS SCORED"|"RUNS" â†’ "Runs"
"OUTS RECORDED"|"INNINGS" â†’ "Outs_Recorded"
"MONEYLINE"|"ML" â†’ "Moneyline"
"SPREAD"|"RUN LINE" â†’ "Spread"
"TOTAL"|"OVER/UNDER" â†’ "Total"

LINE EXTRACTION (CRITICAL):
â€¢ "Over 6.5" â†’ line: 6.5 (exact decimal)
â€¢ "6+ strikeouts" â†’ line: 6 (whole number for strikeouts)
â€¢ "2+ hits" â†’ line: 1.5 (X+ format = X-0.5 for non-strikeouts)
â€¢ "+1.5 spread" â†’ line: 1.5 (underdog)
â€¢ "-1.5 spread" â†’ line: -1.5 (favorite)
â€¢ Binary props (home run, hit) â†’ line: 0.5

SPORT DETECTION:
Baseball indicators: MLB teams, "strikeouts", "runs", "hits"
Basketball: NBA teams, "points", "rebounds", "assists"
Return: "Baseball", "Basketball", "Hockey", "Football"
